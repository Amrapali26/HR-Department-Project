Hiring and retaining employees is extremely complex task that requires capital, time and skills. Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring. Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate.The aim is to predict how many employees are most likely to quit.
